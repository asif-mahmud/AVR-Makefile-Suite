AVR-Makefile-Suite
==================

Atmel AVR microcontroller's Makedile suite


Usage :
=======

Easy to use and highly configurable Makefile suite
for avr-gcc and AVR assembler. See the example from AVR-Makefile-linux.


Version 3.0 :
=============

	* Linux and windows versions are merged. So you can use the same files on both Linux and windows(winavr).
	* Some bugfixes.
	* EEPROM data is saved in .eep file now.


New in version 2.1 :
====================

This version is created specially for those OSs who use "su" rather than "sudo"
to program the target chip. For example it's tested on Debian-7.2.0. 


Windows Users : 
===============

Windows users can use AVR-Makefile-Windows.zip(no color) . Usage stays same.
